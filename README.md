```
Get me out of my head
Drag me out of my bed and make me
Move around to forget
There is time that needs to be wasted
To feel something instead
I will dive in my own delusions
Draping mirrors again
Safe inside of my own illusion
It's the hope that kills you
So I close my eyes till it all fades
And so I close my eyes, then it all fades
Yet I'm still aching, breaking, trying again
But I'll just close my eyes till it all fades
(Ah-ah-ah)
(Ah-ah-ah)
Stepping into the void
Even if it amounts to nothing
Silence is to avoid
Reaching out to hold on to something
I wish I could enjoy
Worthless means of communicating
Words that only destroy
Leave me feeling, fearing, oh
I just close my eyes till it all fades
And so I close my eyes, then it all fades
Yet I'm still aching, breaking, trying again
But I'll just close my eyes till it all fades
I can't help but feel
I can't tell what's real
It's the hope that kills you
So I close my eyes till it all fades
And so I close my eyes, then it all fades
Yet I'm still aching, breaking, trying again
But I'll just close my eyes till it all fades
(Ah-ah-ah) close my eyes till it all
(Ah-ah-ah) close my eyes till it all
Yet I'm still aching, breaking, trying again (ah-ah-ah)
But I'll just close my eyes till it all fades
